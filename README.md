# VOTING BOT

Program takes user access tokens and uses them to bypass email verification to allow each user to vote once per hour.

## Background
I was hired to build a program designed to help a company win a local carwash competition. The rules of the competition allowed each customer to vote once an hour. The business owner recieved confirmation from each customer through the form of their access key (which I created a tutorial on how to access). Once I had this key, I could use it to log in for the customer.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Voting Bot. You will also need [Chromdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConnorInglis18/VotingBot.git
pip install selenium
```

## To run program

```bash
python program.py
```
